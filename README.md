# A* Shortest Path Interactive Visualizer

This progam uses a pygame GUI to allow a user to set two points, a starting and an ending points, and create optional barriers between them that allows the user to view an interesting representation of how the A* algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes. There are several controls for the user such as: 

Left click = create a start, end, and a barrier node. <br />
Right click = deletes/erases the nodes from the grid. <br />
Enter button = executes the algorithm with set nodes.



Here is a demo of the program performing the algorithm with 3 different placements:
